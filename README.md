# Analysis code for "Inhibition of IL6 signalling as a therapeutic strategy to eradicate cancer cells with chromosomal instability"

> Chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of cancer, drives cancer cell
> evolution, metastasis and therapy resistance, and is associated with poor
> patient prognosis. CIN leads to the formation of micronuclei, which upon
> rupture spill DNA into the cytoplasm, triggering activation of cGAS/STING
> inflammatory signalling. cGAS and STING are generally considered to be
> tumour suppressors as they promote apoptosis and immunosurveillance. However,
> cGAS and STING are rarely inactivated in cancer, and while they have been
> implicated in metastasis, it is not known why loss-of-function mutations do
> not arise in primary tumours. Here, we show that inactivation of cGAS/STING
> signalling selectively impairs the survival of triple negative breast cancer
> (TNBC) cells that display CIN. We find that CIN triggers IL6/STAT3-mediated
> signalling, which depends on cGAS/STING and the non-canonical NF-kB pathway.
> Blocking IL6 signalling through the clinically-approved IL6R-targeting agent
> tocilizumab selectively impairs the growth of cultured TNBC cells that
> exhibit CIN and significantly delays the outgrowth of chromosomally instable
> tumours compared to tumours that do not display CIN. Importantly, we find
> that this targetable vulnerability is conserved across cancer types that
> express high levels of IL6 and/or IL6R in vitro as well as in vivo.
> Altogether, our work demonstrates pro-tumourigenic traits of cGAS/STING
> signalling, explaining why the cGAS/STING pathway is rarely inactivated in
> primary tumours, and exposes a targetable vulnerability of cancers with a CIN
> phenotype by repurposing tocilizumab for the treatment of chromosomally
> instable cancers that overexpress IL6R.

cleaning it up.
